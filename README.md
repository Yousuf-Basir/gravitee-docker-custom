This repo is made by following (Custom Install with Docker Compose)[https://documentation.gravitee.io/apim/getting-started/install-guides/install-on-docker/custom-install-with-docker-compose] and it solves the issue of nginx log permission.

Copy `./.env.example` as `./.env` file and change `ADDRESS` to your IP address especially if you use a real IP address to solve connecting with 8083 port
